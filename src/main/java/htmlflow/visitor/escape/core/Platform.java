 * A utility class that provides a thread-local character buffer for escaping characters.

 * reducing the need for frequent allocations and deallocations of character arrays.
 *
 * <p>The buffer is initialized with a default size, and if it grows beyond this size, it will not
 * be returned to the thread-local storage, allowing it to grow as needed.
