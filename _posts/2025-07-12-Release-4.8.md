This release removes the Guava dependency, previously used only for HTML text
escaping, and replaces it with the original HTML escaping source code.

It also introduces ViewFactory.Builder, allowing configuration of `HtmlView`
parameters, such as isIndented, threadSafe and preEncoding.

Finally, it adds a new type of Hot view that recalculates all HTML—including
static HTML blocks— on each rendering, which is useful for http4k integration
with hot-reload support.
