summary: >
    HtmlFlow is organized into four modules: htmlflow-core (Java API),
    htmlflow-kotlin, flowifier, and htmlflow-view-loader for reflective
    function-based rendering. The new mfe() builder allows dynamic HTML
    fragments, supporting both SSR and CSR within a view.

Starting with version 5, the Java and Kotlin APIs are now provided in **separate
modules**.
This means the core **Java HtmlFlow** module no longer depends on the Kotlin
coroutines library, nor on **jsoup** (which is only required by the
reverse-engineering tool *Flowifier*, now moved into its own module).

HtmlFlow is now structured into **four distinct modules**:

* **htmlflow-core** → the main library (`htmlflow` artifact), providing the Java
  API.
* **flowifier** → reverse-engineering tool that translates HTML documents into
  equivalent HtmlFlow view definitions.
* **htmlflow-kotlin** → idiomatic Kotlin API (depends on `htmlflow-core`).
* **htmlflow-view-loader** → reflective inspector for HtmlFlow view definitions,
  loading Kotlin functions of type `T -> String` that return the rendered HTML.

The **htmlflow-view-loader** is particularly useful for integration with web
servers such as **http4k**, which treat render engines as functions of type `T
-> String`.

Added the `mfe()` builder for dynamically loading HTML fragments, supporting
both **SSR** and **CSR** approaches within an HtmlFlow view definition.
