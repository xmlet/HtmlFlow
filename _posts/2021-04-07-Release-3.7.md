When parent template is initialized with a `PrintStream`, any internal use of
`addPartial()` should use implicitly that `PrintStream` regardless the output
approach defined on the partial view instantiation.

This feature implies a couple of new internal methods including a `newby()` in
`HtmlVisitor` that creates a new instance of same type and keeping indentation.
