    New static factory methods view() of the new classes DynamicHtml and StaticHtml
    Removed the static factory methods html(), head() and div() from HtmlView.
    Html code is emitted on the fly when the methods of HtmlApi are called.
    HtmlView is just a container of a template function and an ElementVisitor
    Data binding requires the use of new method dynamic()
    New method of() to enable the use of other methods in the fluent chain.
    New addPartial() to enable the reuse of same HTML template function
    Removed the method binder(). The role of this method is replaced by the concept of template function which receives the context object U that is captured and used whenever is needed, such as in dynamic().

* Improved performance. HtmlFlow is on this date the most performant template engine and Java DSL for HTML.

* Replaced the method `º()` by `__()`.

* New static factory methods `view()` of the new classes `DynamicHtml` and `StaticHtml`

* Removed the static factory methods `html()`, `head()` and `div()` from `HtmlView`.

* Html code is emitted on the fly when the methods of `HtmlApi` (e.g. `html()`, `div()`, `h1()`, etc)
are called.

* Now `HtmlView` is just a container of a template function and an `ElementVisitor`, which establishes 
the HTML output format.

* All emitted HTML is cached.

* Data binding requires the use of new method `dynamic()` to avoid caching. Otherwise, the context objects are ignored on further renders.

* New method `of()` to enable the use of other methods in the fluent chain.

* New `addPartial()` to enable the reuse of same HTML template function with different HTML fragments.

* Removed the method `binder()`. The role of this method is replaced by the concept of template function which receives the context object `U` that is captured and used whenever is needed, such as in `dynamic()`.
