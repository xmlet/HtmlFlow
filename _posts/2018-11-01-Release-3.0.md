* Improved performance. HtmlFlow is on this date the most performant template engine and Java DSL for HTML.

* Replaced the method `º()` by `__()`.

* New static factory methods `view()` of the new classes `DynamicHtml` and `StaticHtml`

* Removed the static factory methods `html()`, `head()` and `div()` from `HtmlView`.

* Html code is emitted on the fly when the methods of `HtmlApi` (e.g. `html()`, `div()`, `h1()`, etc)
are called.

* Now `HtmlView` is just a container of a template function and an `ElementVisitor`, which establishes 
the HTML output format.

* All emitted HTML is cached.

* Data binding requires the use of new method `dynamic()` to avoid caching. Otherwise, the context objects are ignored on further renders.

* New method `of()` to enable the use of other methods in the fluent chain.

* New `addPartial()` to enable the reuse of same HTML template function with different HTML fragments.

* Removed the method `binder()`. The role of this method is replaced by the concept of template function which receives the context object `U` that is captured and used whenever is needed, such as in `dynamic()`.
