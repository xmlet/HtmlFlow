Upgrade to xsd2poet 1.0.8 with two distinct modules, one for the Java and other
with the idiomatic Kotlin API. Now HtmlFlow will be free of any Kotlin
dependency and only htmlflow-kotlin requires the Kotlin stdlib.

In new xsd2poet-java the ElementVisitor does not have visitSuspending anymore.
Now visitSuspending is only part of the Kotlin version.

Also fix issue136.
